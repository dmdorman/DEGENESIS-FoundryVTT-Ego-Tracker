# DEGENESIS Ego Tracker
A simple module for Ego tracking in the 'DEGENESIS: Rebirth' system. Ego Tracker is meant to remind players to spend their Ego at the top of each round. 

When the GM progresses to a new round a form will pop up for all players that allows each player to spend and roll initiative for all characters they own.

Below shows what the Ego Tracker looks like for a player with multiple characters. To spend Ego click on the white diamonds next to the desired character so they turn black. How many black diamonds indicates how much Ego is going to be spent for that character. Red diamonds indicate there is not enough Ego to spend.
